Completion:
Here is a **simple intraday options scalping strategy for Nifty options using RSI and MACD** that you can implement effectively:

---

### Strategy Overview
This strategy uses **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** and **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** on a short time frame (e.g., 5-minute chart) to capture quick momentum moves in Nifty options, ideal for scalping.

---

### Indicators Setup
- **RSI:** Period 14, with oversold level at 30 and overbought at 70.
- **MACD:** Standard settings (12, 26, 9).
- **Timeframe:** 5-minute chart for Nifty index or Nifty options.

---

### Entry Rules

**For Long (Buy Call Option):**
1. RSI crosses above 30 from below (indicating exit from oversold).
2. MACD line crosses above the signal line (bullish momentum).
3. Confirm the price is above the MACD zero line to avoid weak signals.

**For Short (Buy Put Option):**
1. RSI crosses below 70 from above (indicating exit from overbought).
2. MACD line crosses below the signal line (bearish momentum).
3. Confirm the price is below the MACD zero line.

---

### Exit Rules
- Exit the trade when the MACD line crosses back against your trade direction.
- Alternatively, set a **tight target of 0.5% to 1% move** in option premium depending on volatility.
- Use a stop-loss based on 0.3% to 0.5% adverse move or RSI returning to neutral (around 50).

---

### Additional Tips for Scalping Nifty Options
- Trade only between 9:30 AM to 3:00 PM for liquidity and volatility.
- Use **liquid strike prices** near the current underlying price (ATM or 1 strike ITM/OTM).
- Fast execution and low brokerage are critical due to the high number of trades.
- Always monitor margin requirements and keep a buffer as options prices can be volatile intraday[1][2][4].

This strategy balances the momentum signals from MACD with the overbought/oversold filter from RSI, making it suitable for quick scalping trades on Nifty options. You can automate or manually trade it with disciplined risk management.
