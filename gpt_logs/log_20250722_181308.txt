---

### Strategy Overview

This strategy aims to capture strong price moves when momentum breaks out of a recent consolidation, but only when volatility conditions support a sustainable move. It combines momentum indicators with a volatility filter to avoid false breakouts.

---

### Components

- **Market Indicator:** Use the 14-period RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify momentum. A move above 60 signals bullish momentum; below 40 signals bearish momentum.

- **Volatility Filter:** Use the Average True Range (ATR) over 14 periods. Only take trades when ATR is above its 20-period moving average, indicating sufficient volatility.

- **Set-Up:** Identify a consolidation zone or range over the past 10 bars. Wait for a breakout above the range high for a long entry or below the range low for a short entry.

- **Trigger Point:** Confirm the breakout candle closes outside the consolidation range AND RSI confirms momentum (above 60 for longs, below 40 for shorts). ATR must be above its moving average at breakout.

---

### Entry Rules

- **Long Entry:** Enter at the close of the breakout candle that closes above the recent range high, with RSI > 60 and ATR > ATR MA.

- **Short Entry:** Enter at the close of the breakout candle that closes below the recent range low, with RSI < 40 and ATR > ATR MA.

---

### Exit Rules

- **Profit Target:** Set a target at 1.5 times the ATR value from entry price.

- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop just inside the consolidation range (below the range low for longs, above the range high for shorts).

- **Trailing Stop:** After reaching 1 ATR in profit, trail the stop at 1 ATR behind the price to lock in gains.

---

### Risk Management

- Risk no more than 1-2% of trading capital per trade.

- Calculate position size based on the distance between entry and stop loss.

- Avoid trading during major news events to reduce unexpected volatility spikes.

---

### Advantages

- Combines momentum and volatility filters to improve trade quality.

- Clear entry/exit rules reduce emotional decision-makin
